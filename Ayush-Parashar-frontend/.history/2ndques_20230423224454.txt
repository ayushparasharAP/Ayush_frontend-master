There are several problems and warnings with the code:

1. In the `SingleListItem` component, the `onClick` handler is being immediately called instead of being passed as a function reference. It should be changed to `onClick={() => onClickHandler(index)}`.

2. The `setSelectedIndex` function should be passed as a setter function to `useState`, instead of being called directly. The correct syntax is `const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null);`.

3. In the `WrappedListComponent` component, the `propTypes` definition for the `items` prop is incorrect. It should be `items: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({...}))` instead of `items: PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shape({...}))`.

4. The `items` prop is marked as required in the `WrappedListComponent`, but the default value is set to `null`. This should be changed to an empty array to match the prop type definition.

5. The `isSelected` prop in the `SingleListItem` component is being passed `selectedIndex`, which is a state variable, instead of a boolean value. It should be changed to `isSelected={selectedIndex === index}` to correctly compare the selected index to the current index.

6. There is no `key` prop being passed to the `SingleListItem` component when mapping over the `items` array. This can cause issues with React's reconciliation algorithm and should be fixed by passing a unique identifier as the `key` prop.
