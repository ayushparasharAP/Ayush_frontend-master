There are many things in the code we need to fix this to modify the code.

setSelectedIndex should be declared using useState rather than as a function.
The onClickHandler function in WrappedSingleListItem is being called immediately on render. Instead, it should be wrapped in an arrow function to be called only when the list item is clicked.
isSelected should be set to a boolean value indicating whether the current index matches the selected index.
items in WrappedListComponent should be initialized to an empty array instead of null.
The propTypes for items should be updated to correctly use the arrayOf and shape validators.
